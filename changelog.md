# 0.4.0

- remove `get_params` (as that's really for external queries that need to work with Jinja)
- query functions can also take a filename (instead of just a query string)

# 0.3.0

- add `pdx.__version__`
- use "FROM-first" syntax in DuckDB: https://duckdb.org/2022/11/14/announcing-duckdb-060.html
